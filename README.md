# Globe Temperature Prediction

This repository contains Python scripts to predict globe temperature using the predictor variables: radiant temperature, air temperature, and air velocity. Four machine learning models were trained for this task: Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest, Multiple Polynomial Regression, and Multiple Linear Regression. The training datasets were obtained from the ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II. The repository also includes a `requirements.txt` file to help set up the necessary Python environment.

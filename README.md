# Data Science and Machine Learning Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks focused on different aspects of data science and machine learning, with specific applications in regression modeling, data visualization, and random forests. The repository also includes a `requirements.txt` file to help set up the necessary Python environment.

## Notebooks

1. **Artificial_Neural_Network.ipynb**:
   - This notebook implements and trains an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for regression analysis. It covers model creation, training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
   
2. **data_visualization.ipynb**:
   - A notebook dedicated to data visualization techniques. It demonstrates how to effectively visualize datasets using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. Visualizations include histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
   
3. **Multiple_Linear_Regression.ipynb**:
   - This notebook explains the implementation of Multiple Linear Regression, showcasing how to fit a linear model with multiple features. It includes data preparation, model training, and evaluation using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and more.
   
4. **Polynomial_Regression.ipynb**:
   - Here, Polynomial Regression is implemented to model complex relationships between features and the target variable. The notebook covers feature engineering for polynomial terms and model evaluation.
   
5. **Random_Forest.ipynb**:
   - This notebook focuses on the Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning method for regression. It includes training, hyperparameter tuning, and feature importance analysis.
